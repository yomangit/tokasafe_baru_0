CKEditor&nbsp;5 export to Word feature
=================================

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ckeditor%2Fckeditor5-export-word.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-export-word)

This package contains an export to Word feature for CKEditor&nbsp;5. It allows you to generate a `.docx` file directly from the CKEditor&nbsp;5 WYSIWYG editor content.

When enabled, this feature sends the content of your editor together with the styles that are used to display it to the CKEditor Cloud Services HTML to Word converter service. The service then generates a `.docx` document that can be downloaded by the user. This allows you to print your content to the `.docx` format.
