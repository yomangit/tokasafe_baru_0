     * It's possible that more than one suggestion will be created by this method if there are already suggestions with the same
     * `key` but a different `oldValue` intersecting with the given `range`.
     *
     * It is guaranteed that there will be no "conflicting" suggestions, that is, there will be no two intersecting suggestions for
     * the same attribute `key`. If there is a conflicting suggestion, it will be partially or fully replaced by a new suggestion.
     *
     * This method should be used in `callback()` in
     * {@link module:track-changes/trackchangesediting~TrackChangesEditing#enableCommand `TrackChangesEditing#enableCommand`}
     * to inform the track changes plugin about a suggestion that happened.
     *
     * Always call this method inside `model.change()` or `model.enqueueChange()` block to ensure that all operations performed by
     * this method are bound with one undo step.
     *
