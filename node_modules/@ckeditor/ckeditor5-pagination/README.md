This package contains the pagination feature for CKEditor&nbsp;5. It allows you to see where page breaks would be after the document is [exported to PDF](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/converters/export-pdf.html) or [to Word](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/converters/export-word.html). It also respects page breaks inserted by the user with the [page break feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/page-break.html).

In addition to this, the pagination feature shows you the page numbering as well as the total number of pages in the document. It also introduces a dedicated toolbar that allows you to easily go to the next or previous page of the document or jump straight to a particular page.
