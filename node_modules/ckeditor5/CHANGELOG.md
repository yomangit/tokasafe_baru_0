## [43.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.3.0...v43.3.1) (November 6, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.3.1.

### Release highlights

We had to revert a change introduced in `v43.3.0` related to the icons export in one of our packages. This was due to unforeseen TypeScript issues in some setups.

### Bug fixes

* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: Reverted a change related to adding icons re-export. See [#17358](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17358). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/0eb14bee2c5250096f3dd718be599a0188437531))

### Other changes

* **[cloud-services](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services)**: The `Token` class is now exported as a value instead of a type only. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b11d58b3cc235396ee9ab15f9b79daa6a1b04ee0))

## [43.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.2.0...v43.3.0) (October 29, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.3.0.

### Release highlights

#### Performance improvements

We have improved how the editor handles the document structure by making it more reliable and efficient to access specific elements and verify their positions.

* **Node index and offset caching**: The `Node` and `NodeList` elements now cache index and offset values, reducing the need for recalculations and significantly boosting overall performance during model operations.
* **Selection range validation**: The newly implemented `Position#isValid()` method is also utilized to better validate selection ranges, ensuring more consistent behavior in various editing scenarios.
* **Performance improvements in numbers**: The editor now loads content between **3x and, in some cases, up to 6x faster, depending on the type and size of the content**. For instance, where a specific 200-page document previously took almost 25 seconds to load, the time has now been reduced to just 3.5 seconds.

**We’re committed to ongoing performance enhancements**, so you can expect even faster, smoother experience in future updates.

#### **Export to Word watermark support**

A new configuration option has been added to include a watermark when exporting documents to Word, providing additional flexibility in document branding and protection.

#### Notable bug fixes and improvements

* **Suggestions retention on revision restore**: Suggestions are no longer lost in specific cases when restoring revisions with changes from multiple users. The revision tracking process has been improved to ensure that all operations, including markers, are handled and saved correctly during synchronization. This fix resolves issues where markers were previously not retained, ensuring consistent data handling in collaborative editing scenarios.
* **Action dropdown visibility fix**: Resolved an issue where the action dropdown remained hidden after permission changes on comments. The dropdown now properly reflects updated permissions, allowing users to interact with the available actions seamlessly.
* **AI command enhancements**:
	* Custom AI Commands are now correctly applied to individual dropdowns when only one group of comments is present, instead of the entire group.
	* Empty comment groups no longer render, improving UI clarity.
	* Fixed an issue where nested AI command menus would close unexpectedly when used within a balloon toolbar, preventing unintended behavior during selection.

### Features

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced the `getChildAtOffset()` method for `model.Element` and `model.DocumentFragment`. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/d874050e08510019487e2f8cd7ebf7e1ad7a137e))

* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Introduced the `RevisionTracker#getRevisionDocumentData()` and `RevisionTracker#getRevisionRootsAttributes()` methods to the public scope of the editor API. You can use them to retrieve document data saved with the revision.
* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils)**: Made `FocusTracker` extendable with other `FocusTracker` instances to allow logical focus tracking across separate DOM sub-trees (see [#17277](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17277)). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8ca7301b8029967603ed744433740d9a0cde36fe))

### Bug fixes

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: Empty AI Assistant command groups should not render in the UI.

Closes [#17277](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17277). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8ca7301b8029967603ed744433740d9a0cde36fe))
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Made the page unscrollable while the modal is visible. Closes [#17093](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17093). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/926400fc56753731257cd7e79cf140260241387d))

## [43.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.1.1...v43.2.0) (October 2, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.2.0.

### Release highlights

#### Notable improvements

* **Operational Transformation Stability**: Significant changes have been made to the OT system, enhancing the undo functionality and real-time collaboration, especially in conflict resolution scenarios. These improvements ensure smoother editor operations during complex interactions.
* **Performance Improvements**: We have merged several community-driven performance enhancements (thanks @sunesimonsen), that optimize the editor’s core engine. While no changes to the editor’s logic were made, these updates improve overall efficiency and responsiveness.

#### More imports available via `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` indexes

As users transition to new installation methods (v42.0.0+) with `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` as the main packages, we are continuously addressing missing imports for less common classes, functions, types, and utilities, broadening their availability. Since our TypeScript rewrite (v37.0.0), imports can now be made directly through the package indexes, simplifying integration. As many users historically imported from `src`, we encourage you to try the new version and report any missing imports. In the future, we are considering removing `src` from published packages to reduce package size, so the more feedback we receive, the better and more stable API we will provide.

### Features

## [43.1.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.1.0...v43.1.1) (September 25, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.1.1.

During a recent internal audit, we identified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package ([`CVE-2024-45613`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v)). This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.

This vulnerability affects **only** installations where the editor configuration meets the following criteria:

1. The [**Block Toolbar**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/setup/toolbar.html#block-toolbar) plugin is enabled.
2. One of the following plugins is also enabled:
	* [**General HTML Support**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/general-html-support.html) with a configuration that permits unsafe markup.
	* [**HTML Embed**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/html-embed.html).

You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

Taking the occasion, we decided to introduce additional hardening to some parts of our codebase that introduce **theoretical and unexploitable issues**. Our security team confirmed that none of these issues were exploitable in a real scenario, however, we decided to fix them, in order to increase the overall security posture of our software.

## [43.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.0.0...v43.1.0) (September 5, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.1.0.

### Release highlights

This release includes important bug fixes and enhancements for the editor:

* **Block merge fields**: In contrast to regular, inline merge fields, the block merge fields are designed to represent complex, block-level structures, such as a dynamically generated table, a row of products, or a personalized call-to-action segment. Block merge fields are supposed to be replaced by arbitrary HTML data when the document template is post-processed or exported to a PDF or Word file.
* **Nested dropdown menus**: this release introduces a new UI component: nested dropdown menus. They can be used by feature developers to easily provide an advanced user interface where UI elements are organized into a nested menu structure.
* **Customizable accessible label**: You can now configure the label for the accessible editable area through the editor settings, ensuring it fits your system’s needs.
* **Improved table and cell border controls**: It is now easier to manage both table and cell borders. The table user interface now clearly indicates the default border settings, allowing you to set “no borders” (`None`) for tables and cells without any additional configuration.

  ⚠️ In some cases this update may lead to data changes in the tables’ HTML markup when the editor loads them. However, visually nothing will change, and the experience will be the same.

The full list of enhancements can be found below.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **Reverted `config.sanitizeHtml`.** In v43.0.0 we made a decision to move `config.htmlEmbed.sanitizeHtml` to a top-level property `config.sanitizeHtml`. However, we realized that it was a wrong decision to expose such a sensitive property in a top-level configuration property. Starting with v43.1.0 you should again use `config.htmlEmbed.sanitizeHtml` and/or `config.mergeFields.sanitizeHtml`. The editor will throw an error if `config.sanitizeHtml` is used. See the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-43.html#reverted-recently-introduced-configsanitizehtml) for additional context behind this decision.
* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: The structure and presentation of the list of AI commands in the toolbar have changed (a flat filtered list is now a nested menu). Additionally, if your integration customizes this user interface, please ensure your integration code is up-to-date.
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The default `[aria-label]` provided by `InlineEditableUIView` is now `'Rich Text Editor. Editing area: [root name]'` (previously: `'Editor editing area: [root name]'`). You can use the `options.label` constructor property to adjust the label.
